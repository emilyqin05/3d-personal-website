            <h2>SFU PathPals</h2>
            <p>As both a <b>frontend developer</b> and <b>project manager</b>, I lead a team of four developers to create an accessible pathfinding web app for SFU. I coded the front and health services pages using Bootstrap, JavaScript, and HTML, based on a Figma prototype. As a PM, I managed the SDLC, presented bi-weekly to stakeholders, set KPIs, and created a Gantt chart. I identified collaboration gaps and transitioned our meetings in person, leading to increased productivity by 186%. Additionally, I am currently advocating for the app‚Äôs deployment to university leadership.</p>

            <p>It's the website that you are currently on! I designed this website using Figma and developed a 2D prototype with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, incorporating features like zoom-in effects, pop-up boxes, and interactive elements. I then created a Blender model and implemented it with Three.js. I am currently focused on enhancing the UI/UX.</p>

            <p>I served as the <b>designer</b> among a team of 3 developers to create a social media website focused on engaging with endangered animals.

            <p>As a <b>frontend developer</b> on a team of 4, I quickly learned basic C# in Unity within six hours and effectively adapted and communicated with my team to achieve our goals.
